General information
-------------------

fileupload.class can be used to upload image and text files with a web
browser. The uploaded file's name will get cleaned up - special characters
will be deleted, and spaces get replaced with underscores, and moved to
a specified directory (on your server). fileupload.class also does its
best to determine the file's type (text, GIF, JPEG, etc). If the user
has named the file with the correct extension (.txt, .gif, etc), then
the class will use that, but if the user tries to upload an ex tensionless
file, PHP does can identify text, gif, jpeg, and png files for you. As
a last resort, if there is no specified extension, and PHP can not
determine the type, you can set a default extension to be added.
